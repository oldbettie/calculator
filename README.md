# [calculator](https://oldbettie.github.io/calculator/)

##overview
simple calculator app that i used to show of some more basic javascript skills. i added a few nice features like a random number generator that will select a random number between zero and the number you entered. i also threw in a funny easter egg or 2 to checkout.

## project 1.5
this was my project 1.5 in reference to having completed my project for the week in the frst day i wanted to challenge myself so i added this second basic js project using javescript and jQuery. I wanted to see natural progression so utilizing the first week to knock out multiple projects felt better then focusing on a single basic application that really would of just expanded on the css and perhaps some basic animations.

you can checkout project 1.0 if my repo if that interests you also.

##updates
made it screen responsive using vh and vw.
