# [calculator](https://oldbettie.github.io/calculator/)

##overview
simple calculator app that i used to show of some more basic javascript skills. i added a few nice features like a random number generator that will select a random number between zero and the number you entered. i also threw in a funny easter egg or 2 to checkout.

## project 1.5
this was my project 1.5 in reference to having completed my project for the week in the frst day i wanted to challenge myself so i added this second basic js project using javescript and jQuery. I wanted to see natural progression so utilizing the first week to knock out multiple projects felt better then focusing on a single basic application that really would of just expanded on the css and perhaps some basic animations.

you can checkout project 1.0 if my repo if that interests you also.

updates:
made it screen responsive using vh and vw.
